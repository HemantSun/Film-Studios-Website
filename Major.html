        <p>Major film studios are production and distribution companies that release a substantial number of films annually and consistently command a significant share of box office revenue in a given market. In the American and international markets, the major film studios, often known simply 
        s the majors or the Big Five studios, are commonly regarded as the five diversified media conglomerates whose various film production and distribution subsidiaries collectively command approximately 80 to 85% of U.S. box office revenue.The term may also be applied more specifically to the primary motion picture business subsidiary of each respective conglomerate.</p>

        <p>
        Since the dawn of filmmaking, the U.S. major film studios have dominated both American cinema and the global film industry.U.S. studios have benefited from a strong first-mover advantage in that they were the first to industrialize filmmaking and master the art of mass-producing and distributing high-quality films with broad cross-cultural appeal.Today, the Big Five majors – Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., Walt Disney Pictures, and Columbia Pictures – routinely distribute hundreds of films every year into all significant international markets (that is, where discretionary income is high enough for consumers to afford to watch films). It is "nearly impossible" for a film to reach a broad international theatrical audience without being first picked up by one of the majors for distribution.</p>

            Studios are entertainment empires that create and distribute movies and television, run theme parks, and have recording and publishing enterprises. The elements of a film studio include sound stages, house recording studios, digital effects departments and outdoor back-lots, where films are shot. Warehouses store cameras, lights, costumes, props, old sets, and other items of film memorabilia.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Studios also house entire corporate empires including producers, studio heads, writers, designers, directors, marketing departments, lawyers, accountants, and more. They also have commissaries where all studio employees can get a bite to eat. These are basic things that major film studios have. In general they have things like this in mass due to their large stature in the industry.
