        <p>Walt Disney Pictures[3] is an American film production company and subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios, which is owned by The Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer of live-action feature films within the Walt Disney Studios unit, and is based at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. Animated films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar Animation Studios are also released under the studio banner. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.</p>

        <p>Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division; which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation of Touchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one of Hollywood's major film studios.</p>
            
        <p>Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, the others being 20th Century Studios, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and Searchlight Pictures. The 2019 remake of The Lion King is the studio's highest-grossing animated film worldwide with $1.6 billion,[4] and Pirates of the Caribbean is the studio's most successful film series, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.[2]</p>

        <h1>History of Walt Disney Pictures</h1>

            <img src="Images/Walt.jpg" alt="Founder Walt Disney" class="founder">
            <h6>Walt Disney, founder of Walt disney Pictures</h6>

        </div>

        <p>The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day The Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmaker Walt Disney and his business partner and brother, Roy, in 1923.</p>

        <p>The creation of Mickey Mouse and subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio which was renamed as The Walt Disney Studio at the Hyperion Studio in 1926. In 1929, it was renamed again to Walt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success. With the profits from Snow White, Walt relocated to a third studio in Burbank, California.</p>
            
        <p>In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such as The Reluctant Dragon (1941) and Song of the South (1946).[8] That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release of Seal Island (1948), the first of the True-Life Adventures series and a subsequent Academy Award winner for Best Live-Action Short Film.</p>    
            
        <p>Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release of Treasure Island, considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures. By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors as RKO Radio Pictures and United Artists and formed their own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution. By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to his work of L. Frank Baum.</p>

        <h1>Disney's excellence in animation</h1>

        <p>Disney is definitely the front runner when it comes to animation. Even since 1938 they have been a smart and progressive company in the field of animation, today disney are still known as the best animators, and the animating blood within them runs deep</p>

        <p>Aside from its more dubious accomplishments, 2020 marked the 80th anniversary of two of the greatest animated films of all time: Pinocchio and Fantasia, both of which represented creative highs for the once-humble animation studio that turned into an intellectual-property-gobbling behemoth. Nowadays, it is more common for disnney to use CGI and move away from 2D animation.</p>

        <p>While it may seem that 3D animation costs more, considering the technology required for it, the opposite is in fact true. According to Guru, 3D animation does involve more technology, but this technology is cheaper than paying animators to draw each frame of a film by hand. Disney's decision to move exclusively to 3D animation lowered labor costs by making less work for the artists. All the animation is now done digitally with the use of CGI, effectively streamlining the animation process. This not only eliminates the need for more artists but also speeds up the production of the films, reducing the amount of time needed to actually create the film. All of this works to Disneyâ€™s benefit because, with a lower production time, Disney has more time to crank out new content, which is an even bigger win for the audience as they can anticipate more quality content being released at a rapid pace.</p>

            When it was released in 2007, "Enchanted" was an unexpected deconstruction of Disney's classic princess films from the very company that produced them. But despite the film's critical and commercial success, a sequel never materialized... until now. This has been a pretty longed for movie by the fans and it is finally hitting streaming services and cinemas!.
        </p>

        <p>
            Disney+'s "Disenchanted" continues the story of Gisele (Amy Adams), a woman from the animated fairy-tale land of Andalasia, who found her true love Robert (Patrick Dempsey) after her fiance's evil stepmother Narissa (Susan Sarandon) pushed her into a portal that sent her to New York City.
